# Java Note

### Class vs Interface

Class:
- A class desribes the attributes and behaviors of an object.
- A class may contain abstract methods, concrete methods.
- Members of a class can be public, private, protected or default.

Interface:
- An interface contains behaviors that a class implements.
- An interface contains only abstract methods.
- All the members of the interface are public by default.
- Java does not support "multiple inheritance". However, it can be achieved with interfaces. ex implement interface1, interface2
